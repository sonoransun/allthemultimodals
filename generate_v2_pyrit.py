generate_v2_pyrit.py — PyRIT-orchestrated multi-turn + nanoGCG adversarial suffix dataset.

This script generates training data for Bordair's prompt injection detector using:

  1. PyRIT Jailbreak Templates (162 templates x payloads)
     Source: Microsoft PyRIT v0.12.1 (arXiv:2412.08819, github.com/Azure/PyRIT)
     Includes Pliny jailbreaks, DAN variants, academic attack templates

  2. PyRIT Offline Converters (13 encoding transforms)
     Encodes injection payloads through obfuscation layers that bypass keyword filters

  3. Multi-Turn Orchestration Patterns
     Crescendo: arXiv:2404.01833 (Russinovich, Salem, Eldan — Microsoft 2024)
     PAIR:      arXiv:2310.08419 (Chao et al. — ICLR 2023)
     TAP:       arXiv:2312.02119 (Mehrotra et al. — NeurIPS 2024)
     Skeleton Key: microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/06/26/... (Microsoft 2024)
     Flip Attack: pyrit built-in (encoding-based bypass)

  4. nanoGCG Adversarial Suffixes
     GCG (Greedy Coordinate Gradient): arXiv:2307.15043 (Zou et al. — ICML 2024)
     nanoGCG: github.com/GraySwan-AI/nanoGCG (v0.3.0)
     AutoDAN: arXiv:2310.04451 (Liu et al. — ICLR 2024)
     Known published suffixes from literature included directly.
     Live optimization against local model if GPU available (optional).

  5. Combined Multi-Turn + GCG (highest-difficulty samples)
     "Jailbreaking via Adaptive Attacks": arXiv:2404.02151 (Andriushchenko et al. 2024)
     Near-100% ASR on frontier models when techniques combined
