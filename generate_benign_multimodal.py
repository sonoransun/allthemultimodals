Generate benign multimodal examples that mirror the attack payload structure.
Combines real benign prompts from the collected datasets into text+image,
text+document, text+audio, triple, and quad configurations.

All content is sourced from real datasets (Alpaca, WildChat, deepset).
No injection payloads — these are control samples.
